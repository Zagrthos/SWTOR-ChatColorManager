## Tutorials
Available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Zagrthos/SWTOR-ChatColorManager/wiki)!

## What's this?
There were some people who complained about the untransferability of chat colors, thus this application was created.
Maybe I will expand it so you can transfer all settings from one character to another. Or the friend list... or whatever else the game has to offer.

## What does it can do?
- Transfer all chat colors of one character to several others
- Create backups of all changed files
- Live editing of all chat colors in the program with the background of the SWTOR chat window
- Ability to update itself when an update is available
- Supports 3 languages
  - German
  - English
  - France

## What do I need to run this?
An Operating System with the following versions:
- Windows 10 2004 (May 2020 Update) 64-Bit or upwards
- Windows 11 21H2 (Initial Release Version) 64-Bit or upwards
- And the [.NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Don't worry if you haven't installed it. The installer will download the latest version for you!

## Something more?
Nope!

## Why is there an installer?
The installer is used to extract the application on your computer. This is choosen because the application needs the .NET 7 Runtime, without it the application simply won't work.
