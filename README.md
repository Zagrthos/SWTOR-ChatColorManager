## What's this?
There were some people who complained about the untransferability of chat colors, thus this program was created.
Maybe I will expand it so you can transfer all settings from one character to another. Or the friend list... or whatever else the game has to offer.

## What does it can do?
- Transfer all chat colors of one character to several others
- Create backups of all changed files
- Live editing of all chat colors in the program
  - ATM not with the Background of the game chat but maybe...
- Ability to update itself when an update is available
- Supports 3 languages
  - German
  - English
  - France

## What do I need to run this?
An Operating System with the following versions:
- Windows 10 2004 (May 2020 Update) 64-Bit or upwards
- Windows 11 21H2 (Initial Release Version) 64-Bit or upwards

## Something more?
Nope!

## Why is there an installer?
The installer is used to extract the program on your computer. This is choosen because the program delivers the whole .NET 7 SDK with it, without it simply won't work.

## And why is it so big?
Because of the whole .NET 7 SDK. If I would remove it, we could save nearly 180 MB of space but then everyone of you must always install the necessary components to run it.
And I simply want to save you from that. At least that long until Microsoft decides to deliver it always with the operating system.
